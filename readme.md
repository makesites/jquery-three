# jQuery Three

A plugin / extension of the jQuery API for 3d objects (using Three.js)

jQuery Three was developed to bridge the gap between WebGL and the DOM by using existing conventions web designers are already familiar with.

Effectively it provides a higher level api that abstracts Three.js methods to known common conventions from regular web development.
